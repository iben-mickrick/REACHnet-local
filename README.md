# REACHnet-local
The SAS code included in this repository comes from the base ADAPTABLE computable phenotype from the PCORnet Coordinating Center. The code includes additional exclusions to meet the requests/requirments of local investigators. Specificially, these exclusions include:
##REACHnet local exclusions/inclusions 
-1 ICD9 & ICD10 codes for **atrial fibrillation** 
-2 ICD9 & ICD10 codes for **long term anticogulant use** 
-3 At least 2 encounters with **provider** participating in the ADAPTABLE trial 

#
The purpose of this program is to identify patients who are potentially eligibile for the PCORnet ADAPTABLE trial by (a) defining as many of the state trial inclusion and exclusion criteria in terms of the PCORnet Common Data Model (CDM) v3.0 as possible, and (b) applying these criteria to EHR data that have been transformed into the CDM.

This program is build for CDRNs using SAS data sets.
